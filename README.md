# A deep-learning-based experiment for benchmarking the performance of global terrestrial vegetation phenology models

#The code enclosed in this repository includes the novel model stracture associated with manuscript, you can regenerate the training model.

#The input file includes demos of the training data and test data associated with manuscript, you can regenerate the demonstration data results using them or directly use  the trained models to predict regional/global vegetation phenology metrics with multiyear.(the memories of results on a global scale are too big to upload, and the data preprocessing detials can be found in manusctipt)

#The output file includes predicted results on a pixel level (i.e. modeling results of test data(2000 pixels)) associated with our manusctipt.
