# A deep learning-based method to predict global vegetation phenology metrics

#The code enclosed in this repository includes the novel model stracture associated with manuscript, you can regenerate the training model.

#The input file includes demos of the trained models associated with manuscript, you can regenerate the demonstration data results via them or directly use them to predict multiyear other regional vegetation phenology metrics.

#The output file includes predicted results on a pixel level associated with our manusctipt.(although the results on a global scale is too big to upload, the data preprocessing detials can be found in manusctipt)
